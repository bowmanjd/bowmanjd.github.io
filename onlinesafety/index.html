    <h1>Navigating with care</h1>
    <p>Here are a few suggested ideas and resources for your household,
    as you care for one another and engage a digital world.</p>
    <h2>Web filters</h2>
    <p><strong>Note that web filters can never filter out everything bad.</strong>
      Moreover, a motivated person can usually find ways around a web filter.
      A robust filtering solution usually involves a good deal of "cat and mouse."</p>
    <p>
      The best filter: defining when and where devices are ‚ÄúOK‚Äù in your household,
      and when and where they are not. Can we encourage uses that are ‚Äúpublic‚Äù
      (in the living room where
      everyone sees) and collaborative (research something together)?
      Might you consider outlawing devices from the bedroom and/or
      bathroom?
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://www.opendns.com/setupguide/#familyshield">OpenDNS FamilyShield</a> is set-it-and-forget-it, and protects all the devices in your house.</p>
    <p>
      OpenDNS also has <a href="https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/">
      other solutions</a> that offer more flexibility but require more configuration
      and maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does your child's school have a 1:1 program, in which students can bring home
      a device? That may have one of the strongest web filters available, and have
      IT support provided by your school. Ask your school's IT department about
      web history reports delivered to parents. Some schools might provide this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many other web filters exist, such as <a href="https://family.norton.com/web/">Norton Family</a> and <a href="https://www.netnanny.com/">NetNanny</a>. Use what works,
      but use something.
    </p>
    <h2>Accountability services</h2>
    <p>An accountability service regularly sends someone else a list of suspicious
    sites you have visited. Instead of blocking content, as a web filter does, this kind
    of service seeks to give others a window into your behavior.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.accountable2you.com/">Accountable2You</a> is one I have tried and found helpful.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.covenanteyes.com/services/">CovenantEyes</a> has been around for some time.</a>
    <p><a href="https://everaccountable.com/">Ever Accountable</a> looks like another decent choice.</p>
    <h2>Monitoring Screen Time</h2>
    <p>Recent versions of both Android and iOS offer functionality for parents
    to monitor and even manage the amount of time their kids are spending on devices.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/what-androids-family-link-app-and-new-digital-well-being-features-mean-for-you">Android</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/what-apples-new-ios-12-parental-controls-mean-for-you">iOS</a> (iPad, iPhone, iPod)</p>
    <h2>Common Sense Media</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org">Common Sense Media</a> is a wonderful site with media reviews, tips for parents and teachers, and general advice about digital content.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>Reviews and reflective resources by Christians</h2>
    <a href="https://cpyu.org/">CPYU</a> (Center for Parent/Youth Understanding)
    fosters understanding of contemporary youth culture, from a Christian perspective.
    Folks from all over find their resources helpful, but CPYU
    just happens to be conveniently located in our backyard, in Elizabethtown, PA.
    </p>
    <p>
    Focus on the Family's <a href="https://www.pluggedin.com/">Plugged In</a> is an up-to-date
    media review site from a Christian perspective.
